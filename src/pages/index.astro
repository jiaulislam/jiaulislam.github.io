          As a software developer with more than 3.5 years of experience working with Python, I have a proven track record of building robust and scalable web applications using frameworks such as Django, Flask, and FastAPI.
          My passion for programming led me to make a career transition from networking to software development. Since then, I have honed my skills in Python and related technologies to become a proficient software developer.

          I have also worked with SQLAlchemy to develop database-driven applications with ease. Additionally, my experience with PHP and Codeigniter has given me a diverse skillset that allows me to work effectively with teams with different technology stacks.
          Overall, my experience in software development has given me a deep understanding of web development best practices and a proven ability to build high-quality software solutions that meet client needs. My passion for programming and my willingness to learn and adapt to new technologies continue to drive my success as a software developer.
